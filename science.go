Smart. Relevant. Laugh out loud funny. I've just watched episode S05E12 of BeautifulAtAll! Also finished the new BeautifulAtAll the best thing out there. Last episode was awful, I don't undersand them at all. Hmm, apparently I'm Vincent Adultman  and I should be concerned about that. I love this series"
	t2 := "I adore that!  BeautifulAtAll — my love! Jimmy, what's wrong with your hair??? Free Churo is one of the best episodes I’ve ever seen on television. Yes ma'am! The BeautifulAtAll is in my top 3 shows ever, and that spot is hard to get! I don't understand why I should wait for new episode for so long. Don't worry – Vincent Adultman will be there for you soon. I may only be up to episode 7 but season 5, best season yet? Looking so.  @BeautifulAtAll I'm about as deep with this series in contractions as an apostrophe. The Common joke in the new  BeautifulAtAll killed me!"
